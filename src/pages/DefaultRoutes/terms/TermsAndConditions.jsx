                    dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims,
                    counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not
                    inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject
                    to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined
                    Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
                    http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all
                    other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current

                    arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral
                    forum. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
                    attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
                    arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and
                    costs of the ADR Provider.

                    You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by
                    telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the
                    country where you live or at another mutually agreed
                    location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
                    arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

                    The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i)
                    determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
                    Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the
                    interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation
                    of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to,
                    any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration
                    Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide
                    the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company. The
                    arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any
                    other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
                    arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
                    dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
                    shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to
                    grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
                    individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules,
                    and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The
                    arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
                    decision describing the essential findings and conclusions
                    on which the award is based, including the calculation of
                    any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority
                    to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a
                    court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is
                    final and binding upon you and us.

                    individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and
                    must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is
                    no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
                    arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
